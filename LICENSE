This software can be distributed and used under any of the following
licenses:

	CPL
	public domain
	BSD (3 clause -- no advertising clause)
	LGPL (2.1)
	GPL (2)

in rough order of author preference.

The CPL is probably unique to this package, and is described here:
http://www.cypherspace.org/CPL/; if you can't be bothered to figure it
out feel free to use one of the other licenses.  Earlier versions
where distributed just under CPL.  CPL allows you to re-license under
a license of your choice, I just include other specific licenses to
save people having to read, understand and feel confident in the
validity of the CPL.

NOTE: on systems without a POSIX getopt this package will be linked
with the included getopt.c which is distributed under GPL 2.

The following are not licensing requirements, just comments from the
author:

- If you have to make changes to make this library work for your system or
  application it would be useful if you could tell me what you had to
  do, and optionally send me the source changes so I can include them
  or update the library.  The aim is to make a practically useful
  library.

- It would be useful if you could inform me if you use or distribute
  hashcash.  The intent here is to give me feedback and insight into the
  areas of application which people find useful in practice.

- If you are unclear on how to use hashcash there is a FAQ here:
  http://www.hashcash.org/faq.html.  If that doesn't answer your question or
  doesn't apply to your usage, feel free to discuss in email.

- It may help the deployment of hashcash as an anti-spam system if different
  systems based on hashcash were interoperable as far as that makes
  sense for your system.  To this end the FAQ
  http://www.hashcash.org/faq.html and Internet-Draft
  http://www.hashcash.org/draft-hashcash.txt document my
  thoughts in this area.  See also the hashcash home page
  http://www.hashcash.org and paper there as I update with links to deployed
  systems which it might be useful for you to interoperate with.
