COMPILING

To compile type:

	make

to see a list of platforms.  Current platforms are:

	x86, mingw, mingw-dll, g3-osx, ppc-linux, generic

Choose platform (or generic if your platform is not listed) and then
type:

	make <platform>

to use the openssl SHA1 implementation rather than builtin:

	make <platform>-openssl

(ie the platform names with the -openssl suffix link to the openssl
SHA1 implementation).

Note: if you are using the libhashcash.a or linking hashcash with
other software that uses openssl, you will want to compile hashcash to
also use openssl or you will get conflicts with SHA1 function names.

COMPILING WINDOWS

Note the mingw target is using the minimum gnu for windows
(http://www.mingw.org) system.  On that system you have to type:

	mingw32-make mingw

to build win32 executables.

COMPILING WINDOWS DLL

The windows HASHCASH.DLL is also built using mingw:

	mingw32-make mingw-dll

builds a win32 HASHCASH.DLL and HASHCASH.LIB (and a HASHCASH.EXE win32
app that relies on the HASHCASH.DLL)

INSTALLING

To install the compiled binaries type:

	make install

(obviously install that doesn't work on windows, unix only).

This will install the binaries sha1 and hashcash in /usr/local/bin,
and the man page hashcash.1 in /usr/local/man/man1.

To change the binary installation location change the INSTALL_PATH in
the Makefile.  To change the man page installation location change the
MAN_INSTALL_PATH in the Makefile.

For usage information see the man page.

CUSTOM CC OPTIMIZER FLAGS

To override the COPT argument without editing the Makefile do:

	make "COPT=-O3 -my-optimization-flags"
